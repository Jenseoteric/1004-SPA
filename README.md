"Forest Mystery" is my project for 1004.

Forest Mystery is a mystery puzzle text adventure game. Players are presented with sections of story text and then decide which pathway to take. On their journey they must find and equip themselves with certain items, solve puzzles, including a password puzzle, and avoid dangers. 

I wrote the text of the story myself and used AI tools to generate illustrations. The game runs on a web browser and the page is updated dynamically using JavaScript to import “chapter” data from a JSON file and send it to the various HTML elements. It is the first SPA project I have completed.

The project must be run from a local server in order to be able to load the chapters. I have tested the game this way using VS Code Live Server (Five Server) from a PC and Apache from a Mac. Open the local server (Mac) or live server (VS Code) and launch the game from the index.html file.
